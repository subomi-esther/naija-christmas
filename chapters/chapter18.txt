FEHINTOLA.

Few hours later. 3:30pm

I sat on the edge of my bed, my fingers nervously drumming on my thighs. I stared down at the proposal beside me, “

God, what is this?” I muttered to myself, frustration curling through my words. I felt like I was being pulled apart—caught between two impossible choices. My father and the man I actually love.

Saying no to my father felt like stepping into a battlefield unarmed. But facing Dami with this? That was an entirely different war—one I wasn’t ready for, especially after the things he’d said to me today. I sighed deeply, rubbing my temples in an attempt to clear my thoughts.

If I were to choose, the answer is kind of obvious, though. My father would have to wait. I’d deal with him later. Right now, my priority was Dami. He’d poured everything he had into the grand Christmas sales, and the Christmas festival, without considering himself. How could I sit back and do nothing when I had the power to help him? I immediately placed the proposal under my pillow and grabbed my phone. I dialed my father’s number. The line connected after the second ring.

“This one you’re calling me—do you have good news for me?” His tone sharp and stern as usual.

“Dad, I need your help,” I said, my voice steady despite the lump in my throat.

“What for?” he asked sharply. I took a deep breath and began my explanation, detailing everything about Dami’s predicament and why I needed his assistance. Carefully filtering my words, I told him only the things he would want to hear and would spur him to action.

When I finished talking, there was silence on the other end of the line. For a moment, I thought he’d hung up or he toned me off.

“So, I should help him just like that? Is he ready to sell after this?” he finally asked, his voice firm like he didn’t expect a no for an answer. I pressed my fingers against my temples again,

“Yes,” I said, trying to sound convincing.

“Just make this possible for me. I’ll get him to sign the contract immediately after this, I promise.” Another pause. Finally, he exhaled.

“Fine,” he said, begrudgingly.

“It seems like a decent plan. For your own good, you’d better make sure this works out, I’m sick and tired of your excuses.”

“It will,” I assured him, even though I knew that ny words and promises were empty.

“Please, just call the man as soon as possible. If you can, get the place reopened by Monday.” I said, my voice rising with urgency as I leaned forward, gripping the phone tighter.

“Ehn ehn, so now you have the audacity to rush me?” he shot back, his tone irritated.

“Like you have been listening to me all this time?” He said spitefully.

“Daddy, just trust me on this,” I pleaded.

“I’ll make it work.”

“You’d better!” he muttered, his voice low and sharp before the line abruptly went dead.

A sharp knock came on my door almost immediately, I got up from my seat and headed towards the door, I turned the knob and pulled it open. It was Ayo.

“I’m sorry you had to see that,” he said and I flashed him a small comforting smile shaking my head slightly.

“It’s no problem at all,” I said to him and he nodded slowly rubbing his palm.

“I’ll be heading to the village square now, Dami won’t be going today, he’s not feeling well, and you know him, he’s insisting that he can take care of himself, he doesn’t want me to stay with him,” he said and my brows narrowed immediately.

“I’ll stay back too, don’t worry about him,” I said and he heaved a sigh of relief.

“Thank you so much Fehintii, I’ll get going now,” he said and turned to leave.

“Ayo,” I called, he paused and slowly turned to look at me.

“I’d like to extend my rent here, can I do that?” I asked him, he flashed me a tiny smile and nodded slowly.

“Ofcourse! Ofcourse you can do that,” he said, I responded with a small smile too and nodded.

“Thank you,” I muttered my voice barely above a whisper.

****

I pushed the door to Dami’s apartment open and stepped inside. I didn’t have to look far to find him. He was sprawled on the couch in the living room, a duvet draped over his body. His eyes were closed, but he still seemed very alert.

Without hesitation, I crossed the room and knelt beside him. Gently, I placed a hand on his forehead, searching for any sign of a fever.

“Are you okay?” I asked softly. His eyelids fluttered open, and his dark eyes narrowed slightly as they focused on me.

“What’s going on?” he murmured, his voice rough and quiet. Slowly, he sat up, the duvet slipping from his shoulders. I rose to my feet and sank into the seat beside him.

“Ayo said you weren’t feeling too good,” I explained. He let out an exaggerated sigh and tilted his head back, rolling his eyes.

“That boy,” he muttered under his breath.

“I didn’t say I was sick. I just told him I wasn’t in the mood.” Relief washed over me, and I nodded, the tension in my chest easing.

“Aren’t you going to the festivals?” he asked, his gaze flicking to mine. I shook my head.

“If you’re not in the mood, I’ll stay here with you. I’ll keep you company until you’re feeling better.”

A small, genuine smile tugged at his lips, softening the sharp lines of his expression. He leaned closer, pressing a light kiss to my forehead.

“I love you, Fehintola,” he murmured, his voice gentle. His eyes bore into mine, and I felt my heart skip a beat, the intensity of his gaze stealing my breath.

“I love you too, Damilare,” I whispered, my lips curving into a smile.

He leaned in further, wrapping his arms around me in a tender embrace. His head rested against my shoulder, his breath warm against my skin.

“Thank you,” he whispered. I closed my eyes and let myself relax in his arms.

“Ahh ahh, Dami! Don’t cheat me. Six-two is here; it stops here!” I pointed to a square on the ludo board. He chuckled and moved the piece back.

“Dami, I might be a writer, but I’m pretty good with calculations,” I added, his laughter deepening. I picked up the dice container, shook it slightly, and poured out the dice.

“Double six!” I exclaimed, jumping to my feet and doing a small victory dance. I gathered the dice, shook them again, and rolled.

“Double six!” I repeated, turning to him with wide eyes.

“I tell you say I bad! No worry!!” I chuckled as he lifted his nose at me. I collected the dice and rolled again.

“Two-three,” we said simultaneously as I began to move my piece. Suddenly, my phone rang. I picked it up and swiped to answer.

“Oh, okay, I’m coming,” I said, ending the call and placing the phone on the chair.

“Hold on, I’m coming. The dispatch rider is outside.” I stood up from the floor with a small groan and made my way outside.

I walked back into the house carrying the box of chicken I had ordered and a pack of six canned drinks. Dami had gotten up from the floor and was now seated on the chair, a small frown on his face.

“What’s wrong?” I asked, my brows furrowing as I set the items on the table. He slowly extended my phone to me without meeting my gaze.

“Here, you have a message,” he muttered.
