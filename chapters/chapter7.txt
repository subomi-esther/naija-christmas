FEHINTOLA

NEXT DAY.

Tuesday 3rd December.

11:00am.

I rolled over in my bed groaning lightly, my eyes slowly fluttered open, I laid with my legs apart and my hands spread out facing the ceiling. I exhaled deeply, feeling totally refreshed by my sleep. I can’t remember the last time I slept like this.

A sudden loud knock came on my door and I flinched immediately, I was a little relunctant to stand but the persistent loud banging on my door pushed me up.

“Who is that one again,” I muttered under my breath as I made my way towards the door, I unlocked it and twisted the knob open.

“Really? You’ve not stopped sleeping very deeply!” Dami said, a look of relief crossing his face as soon as he saw me.

“I don’t understand. If you want to insult me insult me directly, no be the one wey you go dey go through corners” I snorted rolling my eyes at him.

“Where did you keep your phone Fehintii?!” He asked and I slowly let go of the door knob.

“My phone? My phone?!” I muttered, more to my self than to him as I walked into my house realizing that I had no idea where I dropped my phone.

“Can you call it again?!” I asked and he raised his lips at me in a small playful sneer.

“You better marry someone that can clean up after you,” he said as he walked into my house and closed the door behind me.

“I’m lost. Because you want to help me? Boya you should not help me again oh” (Boya — Yoruba for Maybe) I said, but my phone already began to ring. I searched for it on the chair, picked it up and and swiped on the receiver’s button.

“Hello!” I said bitting back a laugh.

“Why are you like this ?!” He asked with a small smile shaking his head slowly and ending the call on his own end.

“Na why person no dey help person be this,” he muttered under his breath and I laughed even louder.

“Didn’t you say you wanted to go to the market today?!” He asked, my laughter paused immediately and my gaze fell on the time on my phone, 11:20am.

“Shit shit! Dami why didn’t you wake me up earlier!” I said as I rushed towards my room.

“Toor,” he muttered, more to himself than to me.

***

I could feel excitement bubbling through me as we walked into the market, a wide smile spread across my face as I took in the bustling environment, I inhaled deeply and slowly exhaled.

“Weird!” Dami muttered beside me as he began to walk ahead of me.

"It's so good to be back!" I exclaimed, tugging on Dami's arm and pulling him back to me.

"You don’t get this kind of vibe in New York. Everything there is so… organized. Here, there’s life!" Dami chuckled, shaking his head.

"You sound like you didn’t willingly leave us behind for five whole years, oh. Abi are you trying to bribe me with this sudden patriotism?" I rolled my eyes at him.

“I can see you’re still holding a grudge”

“Can you blame me?” He muttered in reply, and I slowly rubbed my hands on my thigh, it was started to get awkward. I immediately darted ahead into a store, calling him over my shoulders.

"Catch me if you can, big mouth!"

Dami sighed but followed, his long strides closing the distance between us. When he caught with me, I was already holding up a set of brightly colored Ankara fabrics.

"What do you think?" I asked, holding one up against myself to show him.

"Hmm." He tilted his head, pretending to examine it seriously.

"Perfect for Ejiro’s Mom. But she might complain that it’s not vibrant enough. She loves looking like a walking disco ball."

I burst into laughter, almost dropping the fabric.

“You’re evil, you know that?"

"But I’m not wrong," he replied, shrugging with a grin.

We continued through the mall, stopping to pick up items like jewelry sets, a stack of fancy Tupperware, and bottles of imported perfume. At one point, Dami insisted on testing every single perfume sample in the store, spraying himself until I had to drag him away, coughing from the overpowering mix of scents.

"You’re a menace!" I scolded, even though I couldn’t stop myself from laughing.

"And you love it," he shot back and my heart skipped a beat. Without even waiting for me to say anything, he spinned a display rack of sunglasses and grabbed a pair. He put them on and struck a ridiculous pose.

"What do you think? Hollywood worthy?" He asked, what the hell is wrong with this guy, what’s with the energy this afternoon. I shook her head, trying and failing to keep a straight face.

“You look like low-budget Harry Potter!” I said, biting back a laugh. He paused, his brow furrowing slightly, before he reached up and slowly took off the glasses.

“You’re so mean,” he shot back, feigning hurt. “This is exactly why you’re single. You’ve probably already met your soulmate and told him to get lost.”

I couldn’t hold it in and burst into a loud laugh. “Wow! Someone’s feeling very attacked right now,” I teased, still chuckling.

Before he could respond, his phone rang. He fished it out of his pocket, glancing at the screen with a frown. I turned back to the rack of items I’d been checking, assuming it was nothing serious. But then, his voice rose.

“Wait, what?!”

The sharpness of his tone made me spin around immediately.

“Hold on, Anu, calm down. Speak clearly,” he said, his free hand gripping his temple. I stepped closer, lowering my voice.

“What’s going on?” I asked, He ignored me for a moment, listening intently before cutting in.

“I’m on my way. I’ll be there soon.” With that, he ended the call, his jaw tight.

“I’m sorry, something urgent came up,” he said, stuffing his phone into his pocket. “You can keep going without me—”

“No,” I interrupted, my tone firm.

“I’ll come with you.”

His brows furrowed in concern.

“It’s fine. You don’t have to.”

“They can manage with what I’ve bought already,” I replied, meeting his gaze.

“Let’s go.”

After a moment’s hesitation, he nodded, and we headed out together.

Outside the Winery

“We’re sorry,” one officer announced. “Operations at this winery must be suspended until we complete our inspections.”

“You are also required to visit our office to address the allegations against you,” the officer continued, his tone curt.

“Operating without a renewed NAFDAC license is a serious violation of the law.”

I stood a few feet back, my stomach twisting in knots as I watched the scene unfold. Dami and Anu stood side by side trying to speak with the officials.

Dami’s jaw clenched as he asked tightly, “How long will the inspection take?” The officer glanced at him impassively.

“Two weeks Atleast, maybe more, depending on our findings.”

I saw Dami’s shoulders slump. Behind him, the officials moved with swiftly, sealing the building with tapes to prevent further entry.

“We need you to come with us to the office,” one of the officers said firmly, gesturing toward their vehicle. Dami turned to Anu.

“If I’m not back in time, please make sure the tree lighting ceremony goes smoothly,” he instructed her.

“Dami—” I called out, rushing up to him. He turned to me, a small, tired smile tugging at the corners of his mouth.

“I’ll come with you,” I muttered

“I’ll handle it. Stay and help Anu with everything.”

“Are you sure?” I asked, worry lacing my voice, he nodded slowly.

“I’ll be fine. Just... hold things down here for me, okay?”

Before I could say any other thing , he turned away and I watched him walk off with the officers, disappearing into the vehicle.

Later that evening.

7:00pm.

The women’s leader, Iya Tomi, approached me with a warm smile, as soon as I walked into the town’s square.

“Ahh, Fehintola, o ma se o!(thank you very much)” she exclaimed.

“We saw the gifts you sent us. The Ankara prints are so beautiful!” I returned her smile with a small one of my own, bowing slightly in greeting.

“Thank you, ma, for accepting them,” I said politely.

As I scanned the bustling square, my eyes landed on Anu, struggling with the huge 14 feet Christmas tree as the center of the square. Without hesitation, I made my way over to her. She was trying to steady the tree on its stand, her face knotted in a frustrated frown.

“Let me help you,” I said, grabbing the tree and guiding it into place. I wonder what made her think she could set it up by herself. Everybody be going through one or two.

“Phew, thank you,” she muttered, looking up at me with relief as she dusted off her hands.

“What about Dami? Any news?” I asked. Anu shook her head slowly.

“Ayo went to their office earlier, but I haven’t heard back from either of them.” She said, I sighed deeply.

“How bad is this?”

“It’s very bad,” she admitted, pulling a box of ornaments closer to herself and opening it.

“We couldn’t get enough sponsors this year. We’ve been relying on sales to fund the festivities.”

“And if the winery stays closed?” I asked, trying to figure out how deep the situation is. Anu hesitated, then shook her head again.

“We’d have to cancel everything. We just can’t afford it anymore.” Her voice was calm, but the resignation in it made my chest tighten.

“It’s already bad enough for us,” she added quietly.

“It’s already bad enough?” I asked, my brows knotting in confusion

“What are you talking about?”

Before she could answer, her eyes widened suddenly, her gaze fixed behind me.

I turned to see Dami and Ayo walking toward us. Relief washed over me as I dashed over to meet them.

“Good evening,” Ayo greeted politely, offering a small nod.

“It’s good to see you again,” I replied with a faint smile before turning my attention to Dami.

“How far? How did it go?” I asked, my voice somehow impatient.

Dami opened his mouth to respond, but a loud voice from behind us interrupted.

“Dami! Is it true that the winery was locked?”

“What?!” Another voice joined in, louder this time.

“The winery is closed? Does that mean no Christmas this year?”

The murmurs in the crowd quickly turned into a noise of worried voices.

“Will the festivities be canceled?”

“How can we survive the holidays without celebrating Christmas?”

“Everyone, calm down!” Dami’s voice cut through the noise, firm yet reassuring. The crowd slowly quieted as he raised his hands.

“Yes, it’s true that the winery has been locked,” he admitted, and a wave of gasps rippled through the gathering.

“But I’m already working on it. And I promise you this, the festivities will still go on as usual, our tree-lighting ceremony will still hold tonight!”

A wave of satisfied “ahh’s” crossed through the crowd.

“In fact,” he continued, a sudden smile spreading across his face,

“I have exciting news for you all. The Christmas Couple Program on Friday will feature none other than Fehintola and me!”

My head snapped up immediately to look at him. Couples what now?

“Are you two a couple ni?” someone called out from the crowd,

Dami stepped closer to me, wrapping his arm over my shoulder. My heart skipped a beat as he leaned in, his voice low but loud enough for everyone to hear.

“Ofcourse,”

“She’s the love of my life,” he said, his gaze locking with mine.

“Always has been, always will be.”

The softness of his voice sent a shiver down my spine, and I could feel my cheeks flush. His words stirred something in me, butterflies fluttering wildly in my stomach.

The crowd erupted into cheers and laughter, but all I could focus on was the intensity of his eyes, the sincerity in his tone. For a moment, it felt real, just like old times, made me realize, just how much I missed him.
