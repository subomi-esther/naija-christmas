FEHINTOLA.

10:30pm

“Put it there!” I exclaimed with a small laugh, straightening behind the camera to get a better view.

“Put it where exactly? Here?” Dami shot back, standing on a ladder as he tried to hang tinsel on the street pole. He glanced down at me, mock exasperation in his voice. I shook my head with a grin and walked over, abandoning the tripod.

“Here, olodo,” I teased, pointing at the spot just above his shoulder. He chuckled as we shared a quick laugh.

“Why didn’t you just say that before?, see the way you too were pointing, like a chicken” he teased in return and we laughed again. I handed him the remaining tinsel, and he carefully hung it up.

“Good?” he asked, looking down at me for approval. I stepped back, hands on my hips, and examined the setup.

“Perfect!” I said with a wide smile.

“Perfect, huh?” he mused, climbing down the ladder carefully. Once his feet touched the ground, he stepped back and looked around with a satisfied smile.

“Wow! It looks even better from here.”

“You did a great job,” I said sincerely, glancing at him. He turned to me, shaking his head.

“No, we did a great job,” he corrected, his grin infectious.

“Boss, the Christmas tree vendor just contacted me,” Anu — the lady I met on my first day here, said as she walked up to us.

“She confirmed our order will arrive early tomorrow morning.” She concluded, Dami nodded.

“Thanks, Anu. You’ve done more than enough for today. You can head home now—I’ll take it from here.”

“Thank you, sir. Goodnight.”

“Goodnight, Anu,” Dami replied warmly, before turning to me.

“You too, Oyinbo. It’s late—you should head home.” I gave him a pointed look and crossed my arms.

“And leave you to pack everything up on your own? We live in the same place, Dami. I’ll stay and help.”

“Are you sure?” he asked, a teasing tone to his voice.

“Oyinbo people like you don’t usually like manual labor.” He added. I rolled my eyes, raising my chin at him

“Abegii, thank me instead of making noise!” I muttered as I walked off, suppressing a laugh. Behind me, I heard him chuckling.

“Na you sabi,” he said under his breath.

“Fehintola, wa na!” (Fehintola, come here first) one of the women called out, waving me over.

I quickened my pace to join the group. I hadn’t had high expectations for this community Christmas event. Honestly, I thought it would be dull and very tacky. But after today—walking around town, hanging up decorations with the town members, and sharing laughter—I couldn’t wait for what the rest of the festivities had in store.

For the first time in a long while, it felt like Christmas. And I never thought, I’d get that feeling in Nigeria.

12:30am

“There are so many beautiful pictures and videos to edit,” I said excitedly, my eyes glued to the camera roll on my phone as we walked home.

“Oh God, everything looks so beautiful already! I can already imagine beautiful contents to draw crowd”

We had finished up the decorations at the town square, and though the walk back home was long, it was manageable because I had company. The cool night breeze brushed against my face as I slipped my phone into my back pocket, a small smile stretching across my lips.

“I can’t remember the last time I had this much fun,” I admitted softly.

“Really?” Dami asked, glancing at me in surprise.

“Even at Christmas abroad?” I shook my head slowly.

“Even at Christmas abroad. I guess I just buried myself in work. There was barely any time for fun.”

“And how did that turn out?” he asked casually, but I could tell right away that there was more to that question.

My movement slowed and I turned to face him,

“I saw the news.” He added, his gaze meeting mine. My heart skipped a beat, and my feet came to an abrupt halt.

“Wait—are you stalking me now?” I joked, though my voice shook slightly. He stopped beside me, his hands slipping into his pockets.

“The Fehintola I know wouldn’t just come back home like that, not after everything you gave up to leave in the first place.” He said

I let out a shaky laugh, forcing a smile to my face.

“Well, I’m sure you’re happy ,” I said sarcastically.

“That one ex who left for a better life crumbled and came crawling back to start all over again. While you’ve made it big.”

I laughed loudly, a hollow sound that echoed in the quiet street.

“It’s hilarious, isn’t it?” I said, the laughter catching in my throat, but Dami didn’t join in. Instead, he reached out and gently patted my hair.

“You don’t have to pretend with me, Fehintola,” he said softly.

“You can cry if you need to. I’ll be here for you.”

My laughter dissolved into quiet sobs, and before I knew it, I sank into a squat, my head bent forward as my misfortunes came crashing down on me again. Six months ago, I never imagined I’d be here—back in Ikorodu at midnight, crying my eyes out on the roadside.

But for the first time in a long time, someone had told me it was okay to break down. Even my own family hadn’t said those words. They had all acted as if nothing had happened, pretending everything was fine.

My shoulders shook as the tears kept coming, I didn’t make any attempt to stop crying, I actually needed it. Even in the last five years I hadn’t had time to rest or break down, it was work, work and work for me all through, I barely even had enough sleep. I worked so hard in proving a point to everyone that I could survive without my father’s name or money, which was why I never sort his help. But here I am now, my career torn to pieces and back to ground zero!

But Dami standing right in front of me was enough comfort.

••

“I caught her with my fiancé. On my bed. In my house.” I muttered. I had cried to my heart’s content and now we’re continuing our journey back home.

Dami didn’t flinch, he just quietly walked beside me.

“We argued, of course. And the next thing I knew, she edited our argument, cutting out all the awful things she said to me and leaving only my harsh words. She accused me of workplace bullying online, and... of course, they would only believe their own”

Dami shook his head slowly.

“I’m sorry you had to go through all of that,” he said quietly.

I nodded, my breath evening out and I exhaled deeply.

“Well... I feel better now, thanks to you.” I managed a small smile. He gave me a thin smile in return and, patted my hair

“You’ve got to stop doing that,” I said, playfully slapping his hand away.

He chuckled, unfazed, and did it again. I stared up at him, pouting.

“Really?”

“Do your worst,” he said with a mischievous grin before tapping my head once more and bolting.

“Oh, don’t let me catch you, Dami! I swear I’ll choke you! You know we’re in the midnight,” I shouted, breaking into a run after him.

His laughter echoed in the night as I chased him, my own laughter ringing out even more loudly. Somehow, in the midst of all this, I felt lighter than I had in months.

“Can you come with me to the mall tomorrow? I want to pick up some gifts for the women,” I asked, glancing up at Dami as he walked me to my door. His brows furrowed slightly, and I shrugged before he could question me further.

“I’ve forgotten my way around, remember?” I muttered, the corners of my mouth tugging into a sheepish smile. Dami studied me for a moment before nodding slowly.

“Alright then. I’ll see you tomorrow—or should I say, in a few hours,” he added with a knowing chuckle. I nodded firmly, gripping the doorknob.

“Thank you for today,” I said softly.

“You’re not welcome,” he shot back playfully, already turning toward his own apartment.

I shook my head with a small laugh and pushed the door open. Once inside, I locked it securely behind me and leaned against the cool surface for a moment, releasing a deep exhale.

Sliding my phone out of my back pocket, I turned on my data connection, instantly bombarded by a flood of notifications. Among them, several messages from my father caught my eye. I hesitated but eventually tapped on one of the voice notes.

-Where the hell have you been? Why is your phone off? Why can’t I get through to you? Don’t you understand the urgency of the situation? Call me as soon as you get this!-

The note ended, only for another to automatically begin.

-“It’s midnight, and you still haven’t responded—”-

I paused the recording and switched off my data again. I can’t even deal with this right now. Why wasn’t he asleep at this hour, anyway?

Tossing my phone carelessly onto the couch, I rubbed my temples and headed for my bedroom.
