FEHINTOLA

Later that day.

2:30pm.

Day 3 of the festivities.

“Fehintii, I’m sorry, but you understand the implications of what I said yesterday, right?” Dami asked, his voice low as he worked beside me. I turned to face him, my movements slow and deliberate.

We were setting up for the Best Christmas Jollof competition tonight, they said it was a usually crowded event that had attracted vendors to buy stands and showcase their products. Around us, people were busy decorating, erecting the stage, and preparing the cooking area where the competitors would face off. Dami and I were putting up the canopy for the vendors who bought a stand.

I nodded, avoiding his gaze. “We have to keep pretending to be a couple, right?” I asked, my voice even. He rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly and nodded.

“Yeah.”

“It’s fine,” I said, managing a small smile.

“It’s no trouble at all.”

Relief washed over his face, and he let out a breath.

“Thank you,” he murmured. We continued working. My eyes drifted toward the tripod I’d set up to record the preparations.

“Be careful with your phone,” Dami cautioned, almost as if on cue. I sighed and dropped what I was doing to retrieve it.

“I can’t even cry if it gets stolen,” I muttered, detaching the phone from the stand.

“We’ll continue the videos after setup.”

He chuckled lightly. “Ikorodu boys are not joking, not even during Christmas.”

“Tell me about it.”

A moment passed before Dami spoke again, his tone shifting.

“I’ve always wanted to ask... Your dad—he’s okay with you staying here for Christmas?”

I froze at his question and I swallowed, willing myself to stay composed. He must have noticed because he quickly apologized.

“I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have—”

“It’s fine,” I interrupted, shaking my head. “Really.”

He hesitated but pressed on gently. “It’s still the same, then? He still blames you for what happened to your brother?”

I let out a hollow laugh, more for myself than for him. It was strange how much I’d shared with him five years ago, the parts of me I kept locked away from everyone else. I glanced up at him. We have been avoiding the real issue between us, dancing around it as if it would dissolve on its own and just disappear like it never happened. I don’t know what this is we’re doing but whatever it is, I like it and it made me feel alive again. Even though I knew that a time would come when we’d actually have to face what drove us apart in the first place.

“Are you okay?” His voice snapped me out of my thoughts,

“Yeah,” I replied quickly.

“Nothing’s really changed between me and my dad.” I muttered, Dami nodded, his expression thoughtful.

“Well, you don’t have to worry about that while you’re here.”

I gave him a firm nod, mustering all the conviction I could.

“Of course not.”

****

10:30pm.

During the Christmas Jollof competition.

“Here let me help you with that” Dami said as he picked up my spoon, scooped a small portion of rice and fed me with it, my eyes widened and I slowly turned to him. He took a spoon also and turned to me with a small nod,

“This is good,” I muttered. We were part of the judges and we moved from table to table of the competitors along with the other judges, taking note of their plating, presentation and obviously taste.

“Need water?!” Dami asked me as we finished tasting and walked back to our seat, I nodded slowly at him. He signalled to get me water, immediately he got the water, he opened the cap and handed it to me.

“Thank you,” I muttered as drank nearly half the bottle, he chuckled lightly at how I drank as he took out a tissue and wiped the corner of my mouth, I looked up at him and smile shyly. He smiled in return and we both turned back to the program.

I bent my head over the gutter by the road side as I vomited, it felt like I was going to vomit my large intestine out. I guess I must have eaten too much that I ate something I wasn’t supposed to and it had upset my stomach.

“Pele,” Dami kept muttering as he patted my back slowly, immediately I was done, he poured water over my head and washed my face for me, I was weak already, plus my stomach was hurting badly. He gently led me up to small bench and made me seat on it. Ayo and Anu walked up to us.

“I’m taking fehintii home now, you guys can hold things together and set down later” he said and they nodded slowly.

“You don’t have to, I’ll find my way home,” I tried to protest weakly.

“No oh, let him take you home,” Anu said immediately, Ayo took out his car keys and handed it over to him.

“Drop by the pharmacy first o, Oyinbo no Dey drink agbo o” he said to him, and if not for how weak I was from the vomiting, I would have laughed. Dami nodded in reply as he bent forward, carried me in his hands and headed towards the car.

“I’m sorry, that I cut your fun short,” I muttered as he turned on the ignition and drove away from the town square.

“You don’t have to apologize, you’re more important to me,” he said, I swallowed hard, still feeling butterflies in the nonsense stomach that was supposed to be paining me.

He made a first stop at the pharmacy before finally going back home.

Before I knew it, we had gotten home, he helped me with the door, placed his hands over my shoulders and assisted me inside.

“Thank you Dami,” I muttered as he gently helped me into my room and made me sit on my bed.

“I’m coming, let me get water” he said as he rushed out of my room, he came back a few minutes later with a glass of water in his hands, he helped me with the drugs and placed it in my hands.

“This should help with the pain and help you sleep,” he said, I nodded slowly as I placed it in my mouth and swallowed it.

“You should have known when to stop,” he muttered as he took the cup from me and dropped it on the bedside table.

“Really? Are you going to take care of me or scold me?!” I said pouting my lips.

“Actually both,” he muttered.

“I should leave you to get some sleep,” he said and I shook my head slowly.

“I don’t feel sleepy at all,” I muttered, his lips stretched into a small teasing smile.

“Just say you’re scared of staying alone” he teased, i just knew that he was going to say something off.

“As you’re the one that has been staying with me na since all these days, Olodo” I retorted.

“Shebi you said your stomach is paining you, you still have mouth to abuse me,” he said and I chuckled lightly.

“Ehn Shebi it’s my mouth l’m using to talk “ I responded.

“We listen, we don’t judge. Remember the first time you came here, and I told you all the apartments had been booked on the app?” Dami’s said, his voice soft . I frowned, my head tilting slightly in confusion.

“It was a lie,” he confessed, a sheepish smile tugging at his lips.

“I just… I wanted you close to me, even if it was for one week.” My mouth dropped open in shock, and I instinctively covered it with my hand.

“You liar!” I managed to mutter, though laughter underneath my words. Dami burst out laughing, the sound warm and genuine, filling the room.

“You can’t blame the man,” he said with a shrug, and a small smile.

“It’s been five years.”

“Dami…” His name escaped my lips, barely audible. I swallowed the lump in my throat, my heart beating loudly as I stared at him, his dark eyes locking onto mine with an intensity that stole my breath.

“Dami, I’m sorry,” I whispered, my voice trembling.

He shifted closer, his hand reaching up to cradle my face, his thumb brushing softly against my cheek.

“You don’t have to apologize,” he said, his voice steady and calm as usual.

“I understand your decision now more than I did back then.”

I closed my eyes briefly, before opening them back up to stare at him.

“But I should’ve tried harder,” I admitted, my voice breaking.

“I shouldn’t have given up on us so easily. I should’ve fought for what we had… for you. Instead, I just—”

“No,” he cut me off gently.

“You had every right to choose what was best for you. You didn’t plan to meet me when you came to serve. Life just… happened. You had dreams, goals, and I didn’t know how to support you without feeling like I was losing myself.”

“But that wasn’t fair to you. I was selfish. I let my fear dictate everything, and I hurt us both.”

“If I had known, I wouldn’t have let you go so easily too and just maybe, you might not have met the asshole who broke your heart.”

I couldn’t hold back the tears that streamed down my face as he spoke. His thumb moved tenderly, wiping them away and I chuckled out tears softly,

“Now that you’ve said everything,” I murmured, my voice trembling with tears,

“what should I say?”

His lips curved into a small, and he shook his head slowly.

“You don’t have to say anything,” he whispered.

Dami slowly leaned closer, and I unconsciously closed the gap between us, my breath mingling with his, and when his lips met mine, my eyes slammed shut immediately.

His kiss was slow, intentional and unhurried. Probably making up for the five years we’ve missed in each other’s lives. His hands cradled my face, holding me to himself and I inturn pressed myself against his body as his lips moved against mine tenderly yet passionately.

I felt the years of separation slowly melt away, replaced by the undeniable truth of what we still were to each other—two people who had never truly stopped loving, no matter the time, distance, or pain.

His hands slid into my braids, deepening the kiss, as my arms wrapped around his neck, pulling him closer. It wasn’t just a kiss, it was a desperate plea to never let go again.

We finally pulled apart, and I opened my eyes to find him staring at me,

“Honestly, I’ll rather be here with you than in any other place no matter where!” He said, a smile touch my lips as he slowly wrapped his hands around my shoulders and I leaned into him.

“Me too,” I whispered.
