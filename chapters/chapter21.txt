FEHINTOLA

NEXT DAY.

Sunday 8th December.

My eyes fluttered open slowly, the throbbing pain in my head intensifying with each passing second. I let out a soft groan and pushed myself into a sitting position, cradling my head in my hands. My fingers massaged my temples as I stretched and reached for my phone on the bedside table. The bright screen lit up, displaying the time: 6:30 a.m.

A message from my mother awaited me. Without hesitation, I clicked it open.

-Would you be able to come to our church today? We’re having a special thanksgiving service, and I’d like you to be there. I’ve already sent out clothes in case you’d be available,- the text read.

I sighed, releasing a stiff yawn as I rubbed my face. So now she wanted me to show up at her church, without any prior notice? Typical. Like I don’t have a life of my own and when they say something I’m just supposed to swing into action.

Shaking my head, I swung my legs off the bed and made my way toward the kitchen. My feet felt heavy against the cool tiles as I opened the freezer and grabbed a cold bottle of water. I gulped it down, hoping the chill would soothe the pounding ache in my head.

My phone buzzed again in my pocket. I fished it out, glancing at the notification. A message from Dami. I didn’t want to open it but on a second thought I did.

-Our winery reopened early this morning. Inspection has started, and we’re preparing to resume production. Thank you for making this happen, Fehintola. I’m sorry for the things I said to you yesterday. Please let me make it up to you. I love you, Fehintii.-

I scoffed, rolling my eyes as I turned off the screen and tossed the phone onto the kitchen counter. “What a clown,” I muttered under my breath.

Tossing the empty bottle into the trash, I left the kitchen, oh so now he appreciates what I did, what happened yesterday?

I stood in front of the mirror, adding the final touches to my makeup. My fingers moved swiftly to my head as I removed the scarf tied around my head, letting my braids tumble down my shoulders. With a small toothbrush and some gel, I smoothed my edges, ensuring they lay flat. Taking a step back, I examined myself in the mirror.

The dress my mother had sent me was a floor-length, powder-blue damask piece that hugged every curve, courtesy of the tight corset sewn into it. The shantilly net fish tail sleeves added a touch of elegance, and the gold shoes and purse she included complemented the look perfectly. I can’t remember the last time I dressed like this. If it weren’t for the faint puffiness around my eyes from crying myself to sleep the night before, I might’ve looked flawless. Still, I was stunning.

Satisfied with my appearance, I grabbed my purse, tucked in my essentials, and made my way outside.

The moment I reached for the gate, it swung open unexpectedly, revealing Ayo and Dami. My heart skipped a beat, and I instinctively stepped back, clutching my purse a little tighter.

“Oooh, who’s this pretty lady on the block?” Ayo teased, his face lighting up with an exaggerated look of admiration. His gaze swept over me appreciatively, and I couldn’t help but smile politely.

“Good morning, Ayo. Happy Sunday,” I greeted him, my voice steady despite the unease creeping in.

“Happy Sunday to you too! Heading out somewhere?” he asked, his tone as cheerful as usual. I nodded.

“Yeah, my mom wants me to attend her church for a thanksgiving service.”

“Ah, yes, yes, o necessary,” he said, nodding as though in agreement of some profound truth.

“We’d have gone to church too if not for the work going on at the winery,” he said and I nodded slowly.

“You look amazing, by the way.”

“Thank you,” I murmured, glancing briefly at Dami. He hadn’t said a word, but the look in his eyes seemed like he wanted to talk to me but didn’t know how to do it. My stomach twisted uncomfortably. Ayo shifted slightly, drawing my attention back to him.

“And thank you for putting in a word for us with NAFDAC. It really meant a lot.”

“It was nothing. I’d do it again if I had to,” I replied quietly.

“Thank you so much. We won’t hold you up. I’m sure you’re going far,” he said with a slight nod, stepping aside and I nodded gratefully in reply.

Dami finally broke his silence, his voice soft as he said,

“Fehin—”

“Happy Sunday,” I interrupted briskly, not allowing him to finish. My tone was neutral as I stepped forward and walked past them, leaving the gate behind me.

After service.

“Omo mi! Aduke! Omo temi nikan so so (my one and only daughter), omo ti o we ton dan (the child who shines effortlessly without bathing),” my mother’s voice rang out with excitement as soon as she stepped out of the church and saw me.

The service had ended a few minutes ago, but as always, my parents stayed behind, greeting everyone they could before leaving. I had grown tired of answering the endless questions about life in New York and why I had returned home, so I decided to wait outside for them to finish their rounds.

“You’re looking so beautiful, my love! I just knew this gown would fit you perfectly,” she said warmly as she reached me, wrapping me in a tight embrace.

“But are you sure you’re eating well? The way your eyes look, it’s almost like we could go and pluck them from the back of your head,” she added, raising a brow as she studied me.

I tilted my head to the side, giving her a deadpan look. She burst out laughing.

“Sorry, sorry! Mo n ba e sere ni (I’m only teasing you). Aren’t you happy to see me?”

I exhaled deeply, trying to suppress my frustration.

“Why are you acting like you’re not the one who sent me away in the first place?” Her cheerful demeanor shifted as she sighed, shaking her head slowly.

“Fehintola mi o ba e ja now (my Fehintola, I’m not fighting with you). You know how your father can be. I just didn’t want any trouble.”

“It’s always about Daddy,” I snapped.

“What about me? Your own daughter? When will you ever consider how I feel about all of this?”

She opened her mouth to respond but closed it again, momentarily at a loss for words. Finally, she sighed,

“Oda ma binu (okay, don’t be angry).”

“This isn’t about ‘don’t be angry,’ Mummy,” I retorted.

“It’s about you standing up for me as your daughter. Every time, you just side with Daddy, no matter how he treats me.”

My voice softened, the pain in my chest leaking into my words.

“If Ola were still here, would you treat me this way? Or is it because Ola went missing because of me, does that make me less of your child?”

“Fehintola!” she exclaimed sharply, her voice sharp with shock and hurt, like she didn’t know what I was talking about. I rolled my eyes and leaned back against the car.

“It’s fine. You wouldn’t understand anyway,” I muttered.

Glancing at the sky, I decided to end the conversation.

“I should get going. It’s getting late.”

“Won bi e da ko get going! (You wouldn’t dare to leave!)” My father’s deep voice boomed from behind. Slowly, I turned to face him, my expression blank but my insides churning.

“Ahn ahn, ninu church! (In the church!),” my mother cautioned, trying to soften his tone, but he ignored her completely.

“You came here and didn’t greet me. O ti wa rude gan (you’ve become very rude),” he said shaking his head at me.

I let out a soft sigh, lowering my head in a small bow.

“I’m sorry,” I muttered.

“How’s everything going?” he asked gruffly. I raised my gaze slightly and nodded.

“It’s going well,” I replied quietly.

“Good,” he said with a slow nod of his own.

“Because as you leave now, Anjola will go with you.” My head snapped up, my brows knitting together in confusion.

“What are you talking about?”

“What am I talking about?” he repeated mockingly, the corner of his mouth curling into a sneer.

“What I’m saying is that Anjola will go with you. I don’t know what you’re doing over there that’s taking so long, but I’m sure she’ll get the job done faster!” My confusion morphed into anger.

“Then why didn’t you just send her in the first place?” I shot back without thinking.

His eyes darkened with fury, and I knew I had crossed a line.

“Did you just say that to me? Ori e o pe ni? (Are you out of your mind?)” he roared.

“E ma pariwo (Don’t shout), we’re outside!” my mother interjected, trying to calm him, but he rounded on her immediately.

“Hm hm, ma dasi! (Don’t interfere!)” he snapped before turning his fiery gaze back to me.

“Anjola is going back with you, and that’s final!”
