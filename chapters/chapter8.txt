FEHINTOLA.

12:00am.

“I’m sorry about earlier, I shouldn’t have used you like that. I just wanted to say something to get the people excited and it just slipped,” Dami said to me as we walked back home. We were done with the tree lighting ceremony and as usual it was beautiful. I got the privilege to place the star topper on the tree and switch on the lights. I had a lot of fun, but still, Dami’s words had my heart skipping a beat every now and then.

“Please don’t take the things that I said to heart, I didn’t mean it that way. I shouldn’t have said them, I’m very sorry if it made you uncomfortable,” he said and a feeling of disappointment crossed my heart but I didn’t let it show in my face.

“It’s fine,”

“I knew you were obviously joking,” I said to him immediately with a small smile, even though I considered his words very seriously.

“So, how did it go with the NAFDAC officers?” I asked, glancing at Dami trying to push my raging disappointment away, as we walked side by side. He exhaled deeply, slipping his hands into his pockets

“You know how it is with these people,” he replied, trying to keep his tone contained.

“I had to... settle them to avoid a bigger mess. Prison isn’t exactly on my bucket list this Christmas.” He said as he released a small dry chuckle, but it carried no real humor.

“And the inspection? What’s the update?” I asked He raised his shoulders in a shrug before responding.

“There’s a waiting list, and it looks like our inspection day will most likely be December 24th.” I froze mid-step, turning to face him as my eyes widened in disbelief.

“December 24th?” I repeated, my voice sharper than I intended.

“Dami, how can the winery stay locked till then? What about Christmas? How are we going to fund the festivities? You promised the people!” My words spilled out in a rush, it was my first time spending Christmas with them and I was genuinely worried about them.

“Dami, say something. How are you going to handle this?” I urged, But instead of sharing my urgency, he smiled—calm, almost like this was no problem at all. His gaze met mine, and he gently placed his hands on my shoulders.

“Fehintii,” he said softly

“Relax. I’ll sort it out. I don’t want you or anyone else to worry about this, okay?” I stared at him, my mind racing with all the ways this could go wrong.

“Dami—”

“I’m serious,” he interrupted gently but firmly. “I’ve got this. Trust me.”

I sighed, releasing the tension in my shoulders, and nodded reluctantly.

“Alright then,” He chuckled lightly as we resumed walking,

“So,” he began, his tone lightening, “how did the women like the gifts you got for them?” My face brightened at the mention.

“Oh, they absolutely loved it!”

“Really?” I nodded enthusiastically.

“Yes! They couldn’t stop talking about how thoughtful it was. I think it made their entire week.”

Dami laughed, a sound full of warmth, his laughter filled the silent street, making my heart race faster again.

Next day

Wednesday 4th December.

9:30am.

I adjusted the scarf on my head, tying it tightly as I scrolled through the Chowdeck app in search of a restaurant to order food from. My phone buzzed suddenly, and a name flashed across the screen. Mr. Bankole. Of course.

With a sigh, I tapped the green button and held the phone to my ear.

“For picking my call, you must be very stupid!” my father barked as soon as the line connected. I leaned back into the couch, exhaling deeply as I rolled my eyes. That phrase had been his favorite while I was growing up—it didn’t even register as an insult anymore.

“Four days, Fehintola! Four days since you left, and you didn’t think to call and update us?” His voice rose with each word, sharp and obviously angry.

“I kept calling you, and you deliberately turned off your phone to avoid me! You ignored all my texts! What the hell is wrong with you?”

“Are you there? Eti e di ni? O le sóró ni!” (Are you deaf? Can’t you speak?)

“I’m sorry, sir,” I managed to say, keeping my tone calm.

“You’re sorry? Iwo jebi!” (You shouldn’t have been) he muttered bitterly.

“I’m sorry, sir,” I repeated.

“I have everything under control. I’ll reach out to you if there’s any important news. Please don’t stress yourself over this.”

“Shut your mouth! Don’t tell me what to do!” he snapped.

“I’ll keep calling you. Ti won ba ti bi e da, don’t pick my calls!” (If they gave birth to you well, don’t answer my calls!)

And with that, he ended the call.

I stared at the phone in my hand for a moment before dropping it on the couch, letting out a long, shaky sigh. Memories of how our relationship had turned sour came rushing back, filling me with a pain I’ve gotten so used to.

*FLASH BACK*

EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO

The carnival buzzed with life as seven-year-old Fehintola and her nine-year-old brother, Farayiola, made their way through the bustling crowd with their father, Mr. Bankole. The air was filled with the mingling scents of roasted peanuts and sugary treats, but the joy of the day was waning as it was getting dark already. Farayiola was limping, his face pinched with pain. He had taken a hard fall on a steep road earlier and could barely walk.

Ahead, the bright lights of an ice cream truck caught Fehintola’s eye. She tugged on her father’s hand,


“Dad, I want ice cream!” she exclaimed, pointing excitedly at the truck. Mr. Bankole glanced down at her, his face lined with fatigue.

“Tola, you’ve had enough sugar for today,” he said firmly.

“Besides, your brother can’t walk that far, and we need to get home. I’ll buy you some ice cream when we get home.”

But Fehintola was already used to getting what she wanted when she wanted it. She shook her head, her braids bouncing as she stomped her feet.

“No, I want this one!” she cried, her voice rising into a tantrum.

Farayiola, wincing with each step, spoke up, his tone calm despite his discomfort.

“Don’t worry, Daddy. I’ll wait right here. You can go and get it for her.” Mr. Bankole hesitated, frowning at his son’s offered.

“No,” he said sternly. “Nobody is getting anything. Let’s go home.”

But Fehintola wouldn’t relent, her cries drawing stares from passersby. With a weary sigh, Mr. Bankole relented, though annoyance flickered in his expression.

“All right, fine. Ola, sit here and don’t move,” he instructed, guiding his son to a small bench by a vendor’s stand. “I’ll be back quickly.”

Farayiola nodded obediently, and Mr. Bankole took Fehintola’s hand, leading her toward the ice cream truck.

The queue at the truck was longer than expected, and by the time they returned, Farayiola was gone.

Mr. Bankole froze, his eyes scanning the crowd frantically. His heart began to pound.

“Ola!” he called, his voice sharp with panic. He turned to the nearby vendor.

“Did you see a boy sitting here? My son?” The vendor shrugged, his face indifferent.

“Why would you leave a child alone in a place like this?”

Mr. Bankole’s anxiety turned to anger, but there was no time to argue. He grabbed Fehintola’s hand and began searching the carnival grounds, calling out his son’s name.

As the minutes stretched into hours, his desperation grew. Announcements were made over the loudspeakers, but Farayiola remained missing. The once vibrant carnival was now nearly deserted as everyone had dispersed to go home, the laughter and music replaced by silence and shadows.

Exhausted, Mr. Bankole sat heavily on a bench, his face etched with worry and regret. Fehintola, clutching her uneaten ice cream cone, approached him cautiously.

“Dad… where’s Ola?” she asked softly, her voice trembling. Her question ignited a storm of emotion.

“Sha róra fi mi sile!” (Just leave me alone!) Mr. Bankole exploded, his voice thunderous. His eyes, red with anguish, glared at her.

“Is it not your foolish tantrum for ice cream that caused this?!” he shouted, his words cutting through the night.

“Now that you’ve had your ice cream and your brother is gone, are you happy?!”

Tears spilled from Fehintola’s eyes as she stepped back, startled by his tone, it was the first time he was speaking to her with so much anger.

“You spoiled little girl,” he continued, his voice shaking with rage.

“Haven’t I given you everything you’ve ever wanted? I told your mother! I told her she was spoiling you rotten, and now—”

He broke off, his voice cracking. Strangers nearby tried to intervene and murmuring words of comfort.

“She’s just a child,” one woman said gently. “Take it easy on her. You’ll find your son.”

But Mr. Bankole barely heard them. His head dropped into his hands. Fehintola stood frozen, clutching her ice cream cone, her own tears falling silently.

*******

Eighteen years had passed, and my brother was still missing. His absence remained an open wound, and my relationship with my father had only grown worse over the years.

A soft knock interrupted my thoughts.

“Fehintola, are you awake?” Dami’s voice came from the other side of the door. I exhaled deeply, dragging myself up, and headed towards the door as I opened it.

“I made breakfast. Have you eaten? Would you like to join us?” he asked, I hesitated, unsure if I should intrude.

“I hope I’m not being a bother,” I murmured.

“Of course not,” he replied with a reassuring smile. “I wouldn’t ask if you were.” I nodded slowly,

“Okay. Let me freshen up, and I’ll join you shortly.”

---

Twenty minutes later

I was just settling into the lively atmosphere at the breakfast table when Ayo, Dami’s younger brother, suddenly blurted out,

“Wait, hold on! Dami, is this the Fehintola you always talk about”

Dami and I exchanged glances, and I caught the faintest trace of nervousness in his eyes.

“Wh-what do you mean by always talk about,” he muttered stuttering lightly.

“Yes, yes, I am,” I said with a small laugh, trying to break the tension. Ayo’s eyes widened in exaggerated disbelief.

“Iro ni o!” (It’s a lie!) His gaze lingered on me, scrutinizing every detail as if to confirm what he’d just heard.

“But aunty,” he continued, leaning forward, “wetin you do my brother no good sha!”

“Ayo!” Dami interjected sharply, shooting him a warning look. Ayo laughed, raising his hands defensively.

“I’m joking! Relax, relax! I’ll let bygones be bygones… until I buy gun.” He burst out laughing at his own joke, and despite myself, I joined in awkwardly.

His phone suddenly buzzed, interrupting the moment. He glanced down and sighed.

“Duty calls,” he announced, getting to his feet.

“But you haven’t finished your food,” Dami pointed out.

“I’ll put it in the freezer and finish later. This is urgent!” Ayo replied, heading for the kitchen to drop off his plate. Dami shook his head, a playful smirk on his face.

“You’ll never eat properly. That’s why your head is bigger than your body. Who will marry you like this?”

“You marry first na. Let’s see.” Ayo shot back without missing a beat. He walked out, slamming the door softly behind him.

I bit back a laugh, amused by their sibling banter.

“I didn’t know you had a brother,” I said, turning to Dami.

He nodded. “Yeah, he was studying in Ibadan before. He came to stay with me when I decided to settle here in Lagos.”

“Wow,” I murmured. “And your parents? Are they based in Ibadan too?” He hesitated for a moment before answering, his voice quieter now.

“No parents. My dad left before I was born, and my mom… well, she left when I was eight. She went out one day to get something and never came back.” I froze, immediately regretting the question.

“Oh, Dami… I’m so sorry. I didn’t know.” He shrugged, waving it off.

“It’s fine jor. This life, na today?” He picked up a piece of chicken and bit into it, clearly trying to lighten the mood.

“But you weren’t alone,” I offered gently.

“Atleast Ayo’s here.” A small smile crossed his lips, and he nodded.

“Yeah. Ayo’s not actually my biological brother. We met in the neighborhood where I grew up. We were about the same age—though I think I’m a year older. We just clicked. Took care of each other when no one else would.”

I stared at him, speechless. He didn’t seem like this kind of person, he’s just a very happy soul, and I just realized we never really talked about him. Instead he was always there for me to listen to me and confort me after every fight I had with my dad while I was still here before.

“That’s… that’s surprising,” I finally said, my voice soft.

“But you guys look very good together, I admire your relationship most times” Dami chuckled, the sound light but it seemed like he was reminiscing old times.

“It wasn’t so cute back then, trust me. We endured a lot. Clashed plenty of times too—our personalities didn’t always mix. But somehow, we made it through. Thank God for life.”

I nodded, the respect I felt for him deepening.

“Yeah,” I murmured.
