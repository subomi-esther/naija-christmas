FEHINTOLA

6:00pm

“Let us all eat and be merry!”

“My son, the one who has been missing for over twenty years, has finally returned!” my father boomed, his voice filled with triumph as he pushed the great doors wide open.

I blinked, taking in the elaborate decorations. What?! When had they even planned all this? Then again, knowing my father, this wasn’t beyond him.

A feast, a celebration, a welcome home… all for Ayo. Yet, when I returned, nothing. Not even half of this. Show me my place without telling me. I shook my head, slinging my bag over my shoulder as I turned toward my room.

“Don’t make me send for you before you come back down!” my father called after me.

“Son,” his voice softened as he turned back to Ayo,

“I’ve had new clothes prepared for you. Change into them and come down for dinner.” The excitement in his rang clear as day.

---

“I’m sorry for letting you suffer so long. Looking back, I should have searched harder, searched better.”

Ayo set down his spoon and met his gaze calmly.

“You wouldn’t have found me, still. I strayed. I climbed into a van to rest when I couldn’t find you. The driver didn’t even know I was there. By the time I realized it, I was already in Ogun State.”

“Ahh, omo mi…” my mother whispered, wrapping her arms tightly around him, resting her head on his shoulder.

“We’re sorry,” she murmured through quiet sobs.

Ayo smiled faintly, nodding, and gently patted her hair. I hated myself for thinking it, but all I wanted was for someone to acknowledge the elephant in the room. Everyone was acting like nothing else mattered, like we didn’t just ruin someone’s life where we’re coming from.

“There’s no need for apologies,” Ayo said softly. “Everything happens for a reason. That journey shaped me. Who knows what kind of man I’d be if not for it? Perhaps not the son you’d be proud of. But I met the best people on earth. Yes, life was hard, but it wasn’t all suffering. We had our small joys too.”

“ And through it all, I know God was with me.”

“Ahh, omo mi… Oluwa, ese o,” (My child. Thank you God) my mother wept again, clinging tighter to him.

“Which is why,” Ayo continued gently,

“I don’t want you to take the winery away from Dami. Me of all people know what it means to him. That’s everything he has.”

My father’s face hardened at once.

“No! We will not talk about that miserable boy tonight. Today is a day of joy for my family.”

“Dami is not miserable!” Ayo and I snapped at once. Our eyes met across the table, and he gave me a subtle look, telling me to let him handle it. With a heavy sigh, I sank back into my chair.

“I have hazy memories of you from my childhood,” Ayo began, his voice steady and surprisingly very calm. I didn’t think the day would come when I’d see Ayo this serious. He was always the playing one.

“But one thing I know for sure is that my father was the sweetest and kindest man.”

He leaned forward, locking eyes with the man across the table.

“As children, we always preferred your company. That’s the only reason we’d choose to go to a carnival with our father instead of our mother.”

A brief silence followed before he continued, his tone sharpening.

“But now… when I look at you, when I listen to the way you speak, I can’t recognize you anymore.”

“You’ve become so business-oriented, treating people like pawns on a chessboard. I can’t believe the same man who once carried me on his shoulders is the one who sent those ridiculous contracts to D&A Winery. God, it’s still so hard to believe.”

Ayo shook his head, disappointment etched into his features.

“I know I was only five then, but I looked up to you. I wanted to be like you. Now, I don’t even know who you are.”

I glanced at my father. His clenched jaw and tightened grip on the table told me Ayo’s words were hitting the right spot. Very good. Nobody in this house had ever dared to stand up to him, not even my mother.

Maybe Ayo’s return was exactly what we needed, because I, too, had had enough.

“I’m sorry it’s come to this,” Ayo continued, voice firm.

“But we have to talk about it now. You’ll have to choose. If you forcefully take the winery, you’ll lose me. And if that happens, you’ll never find me again.”

“Ahhh! Farayiola!” My mother exclaimed, releasing his arm in shock.

“I came here today out of courtesy,” Ayo said, his tone softer now.

“Because no matter what, you’re still my father, and I wasn’t going to deny you the joy of seeing your son after so many years. But I’ll only stay here for one day. During this one day, you must decide what matters most. The person who really needs me is Dami.”

He pushed his chair back and rose to his feet.

“You’re all joking with me!” My father suddenly roared, slamming his palm on the table so hard the plates rattled.

“If I let go of that winery, I’ll withdraw my word with NAFDAC. I’ll make sure that boy eats dust with his so-called winery!” His voice was thunderous.

“You think it’s sentiments and emotions that got me this far?!”

He jabbed a finger in Ayo’s direction.

“People change, Farayiola! That’s what it means to be a man! You’re my son, you should toughen up. One day you’ll take over this family business, and if you lead with your emotions, you’ll go nowhere!”

Ayo gave a bitter chuckle and shook his head.

“So it’s no longer Fehintola who’ll take over, it’s me now? You didn’t even bother to ask if it’s what I want.” His gaze hardened.

“You’ve really changed, Mr. Banks.”

With that, he turned sharply and walked out. I have imagined different scenarios of what it’d be like if my brother ever returned. But this particular one we’re in ? I never imagined it!

I pushed back my chair too, my chest tight with anger.

“If you choose to ruin the winery, you’ll lose me as well. That shouldn’t bother you though, I’ve always been the heavy weight you wanted to shed”

I didn’t wait for a reply. I stood and stormed out, heading straight for my room.

“Ahhh Kola! O sha fe b’aye mi je!” my mother cried after me. (Kola! You just want to ruin my life!)

“If my children dare abandon us, Kola! mi o shey mo!” (I’m no longer interested!)

“Gra gra e ti poju! Tinu mi ni ma se!” (Your arrogance is too much! You’ll do whatever you want!)

“See where it has landed us! You’re about to lose everything! Ohh, you think you’re a successful man? You couldn’t even keep two children together!”

Her voice broke, but she pressed on, shouting at him.

“You’d rather choose money over your own children! And I warned you, Kola! I warned you! I told you to take it easy with this girl, but no! You chose to frustrate the life out of her!”

“I think you’ve gotten what you wanted no?!”

By the time I reached my room, her words were still echoing through the walls, spilling into every corner of the house.

“Kolawole Bankole! If you know what’s good for you, you’ll fix this!”

I shut the noise out, sliding open the glass door to my balcony. The cool night air washed over me as I stepped outside, desperate to breathe.

Meanwhile

DAMILARE

I curled myself on my bed in a foetal position and just let my tears flow. I was too tired to consider anything, too broken to think about anything. I just wanted to sleep for a very long time, but the ache in my chest won’t let me.

My phone has been ringing nonstop, everytime of them asking why I wasn’t at the carnival, I turned it off and threw it to one side of the room.

I’ve lost everything. Am I cursed? Why do I always end up along, everything and everyone I ever truly loved ends up taken away from me, is this really how my destiny was written? Why do I have to have everything hard in my own lifetime.

“Why?!”
