FEHINTOLA

8:00pm

Day 5 of festivities.

Christmas Couple.

The massive Christmas tree we decorated three days ago , stood proudly at the center, sparkled with red and gold ornaments, and I couldn’t help but feel a sense of joy. It had taken days even after the tree lightening to make this tree look this perfect.

I stood on the decorated stage, dressed in my shimmering green sample lace gown and my gele tied to perfection, when Dami said we’d be featuring in the Christmas couple event, I didn’t know he meant hosting, but I loved it.

I glanced at Dami, who was adjusting his microphone, looking regal in his white senator up and down embroidered with silver thread. His ease with the crowd always amazed me. He caught my eye and looked away immediately. I chuckled lightly at his pettiness , he had actually been avoiding me since what happened on our way to the market happened. Immediately Anu signalled to me that it was time to start, I stepped forward, gripping the microphone.

“Ẹ kaabo, ẹyin gbogbo ebi mi ati ọrẹ mi!” (Welcome Everybody, family and friends) I greeted, my Yoruba accent still very funny, the crowd bursted into laughter.

“Speak English, we understand,” the crowd chanted and I giggled.

“Welcome, Welcome, everyone, to this year’s Christmas Couple Contest! Who’s ready for some fun tonight?” I finally said in the language I was fluent with.

The roar of the crowd was defeaning, their excitement fueling my own. As the days passed, the crowd at each festivities increased.

Dami raised his hand, and the crowd quieted, though not without some lingering giggles.

“Ah-ah, Ikorodu people! Easy o!” he said with a laugh.

“We haven’t even started yet. But tonight, we’re about to find out who the best couple in ikorodu is! Are you ready?”

Their thunderous response again made me grin. I loved these moments— and even if a day comes where I have to return to my base, I would never forget this.

“Okay,” I continued, stepping closer to the edge of the stage.

“Here’s how it works. Our contestants will face three exciting rounds: Christmas Trivia, Dance-Off, and Couple’s Sync. The couple with the highest points at the end wins a luxurious weekend getaway to a private resort in Epe and many other gifts!”

“Oluwa a se o!” (Thank God) a woman shouted from the audience, and I couldn’t help but laugh along with everyone else. Dami waved me forward, still avoiding my eyes.

“Let’s not waste time,” he said. “Please welcome our contestants to the stage!”

I watched as ten couples climbed onto the stage. Each one brought their own energy—the young pairs in matching Ankara outfits, the newlyweds glowing in white and gold, and a particular couple, who wore Santa hats and had cheeky grins that immediately endeared them to the audience. As soon as they took their position on the stage, we got to games immediately.

I took charge of the trivia round, my voice steady as I read the first question. “What is the Yoruba name for Christmas?”

The first couple answered eagerly, “Odun Keresimesi!”

“Correct!” I said, clapping my hands in encouragement.

The questions flowed seamlessly, each correct answer met with cheers from the audience. Dami’s playful commentary kept everyone engaged.

“So what’s your husband’s favourite food”

“Jollof rice, moi moi, and goat meat,” an elderly couples answered.

“Ah-ah, you people want to make us hungry! 10 points!” Dami said immediately, His laughter that followed warmed my heart.

•••

“Now! We’ll go into the next activities immediately!” Dami announced as soon as we were done with the trivia.

“Couples, show us your best moves!” He said and the crowd erupted in excited screams. The DJ spun up Burna Boy’s “Last Last”.

“Ahhh, no! no! no! Breakfast ke!” The couples said shaking their heads and refusing to dance. The audience erupted in laughter and the DJ immediately changed it to another music.

The couples took turns dancing. I couldn’t help but laugh as the Santa-hat couple attempted zanku and leg work dances, their antics sending the crowd into hearty laughter. My cheeks hurt from smiling so much.

After that we moved to the final and last round, I handed out small whiteboards to each couple, explaining the rules.

“Let’s see how well you know your partner!”

The questions led to hilarious moments. One man looked bewildered when his wife wrote down money as her favorite Christmas gift from last year.

“But I gave you a handbag!” he protested.

“Yes, but I used the money to buy it myself,” the woman shot back, sending the audience into fits of laughter.

****

We were finally done, the DJ engaged the crowd with music and they danced as Dami tallied the points. Finally, Dami grabbed the microphone, and the DJ lowered the music.

“And the winner of this year’s Christmas Couple Contest is…” He paused for effect, his gaze sweeping the eager faces.

I leaned in, grinning as I said, “Mr and Mrs Adeleye! The Santa hat couple!”

The crowd erupted as the winning couple jumped in excitement. They hugged each other tightly as Dami handed them the envelope containing the resort voucher. I pinned the sash reading “Best Christmas Couple 2024” over their shoulders, the joy on their faces lighting up the stage.

“Thank you all for making tonight magical,” I said, addressing the crowd. “We hope you enjoyed it as much as we did!”

Dami stepped forward, his voice booming over the microphone.

“Ẹyin gbogbo ẹ ma gbadun Keresimesi yin o! Merry Christmas in advance, Ikorodu!” (Everyone keep Enjoying the holidays)

“Dance!” One of the couple on stage said, I turned to look at them with raised brows.

“Yes! You guys should dance!” Another couple said and very soon the crowd broke out in a soft chant.

“Dance, Dance!” I slowly turned to look at Dami and I raised my shoulders in a small shrug. He rolled his eyes to the back of his head, obviously doing his very best to not smile. He gently stepped closer to me and stretched his hands out to me, I bowed slightly dramatically and placed my hands in his and he led me down stage. The DJ began to play, Ed sheeran’s perfect.

His hands slowly circled around my waist, pulling me closer, my breath hitched as his touch sent a warmth spreading through me. I slowly raised my hands and placed it on his arms, entwining our right hands. We stared deeply into each other eyes and slowly began to move to the rhythm of the song. His jaws clenched and unclenched lightly as he stared at me, a look of tenderness in his eyes, after a while other couple joined us.

“Don’t tell me you’re still mad at me,” I muttered, he scoffed and slowly looked away from me.

“I won’t tell you,” you muttered.

“Dami, look at me,” I whispered and he slowly turned back to me.

“Dami, I’m sorry. I understand how that made you feel, I just didn’t want you to fight with anybody,” I said.

“Hmm, I hear you,” he muttered.

“Dami, I said I’m sorry, forgive me?” I asked, his gaze studied my face trying to keep his smile in check.

“Do I have a choice?!” He asked, I chuckled lightly and shook my head slowly.

“You don’t,” I muttered and we both shared a laugh.

“You know,” Dami said in a low voice, his eyes locked on mine,

“I’m not much of a dancer.” I let out a soft laugh, trying to ignore the way my heart raced at his closeness.

“You’re doing just fine,” I whispered, my voice barely audible over the music.

He spun me gently, his grip steady yet tender, and as I came back into his arms, our eyes met again.

“See?” I teased, a small smile tugging at my lips. “Not so bad after all.”

“Maybe,” he murmured, his gaze softening.

“But it’s only because I have the perfect partner.” He said and the music, slowly came to an end.

“Ohh look! We have our mistletoe couple!” The Dj said through the mic on stage, I felt everyone eyes on us, I slowly looked up and I realized we were standing under a mistletoe. I swallowed hard as I slowly lowered my gaze to look at Dami.

“You —“ Before I could complete my statement, he leaned forward and slammed his lips on mine, taking my lips in his and the crowd broke out in wild screams.
