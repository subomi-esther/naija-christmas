FEHINTOLA

“What do you mean how did they find you? They’re my parents, Ayo. They came here for me,” I said quickly, my voice sharper than I intended. Even though I knew exactly where this was headed. From their reactions it was clear.

Ayo turned slowly, his eyes filled with expressions I couldn’t quite understand.

“Five days ago,” he began, his tone low but steady,

“Anu slipped and told me the real reason you’re here.”

The words slammed into me. My hands fell uselessly to my sides as I staggered back, both disbelief and washing over me.

“I always knew a big company was trying to buy us out,” he continued,

“but I never cared much for the details. We weren’t interested.” He drew in a breath, his jaw tightening.

“Then when she told me, I ran a background check on the Banks family. Everything… came back to me.”

Dami rushed forward at once, gripping Ayo’s shoulders, shaking him desperately.

“What are you talking about?” Dami’s voice trembled, like he was one word away from crying. Ayo dropped his gaze.

“I didn’t know how to tell Fehintii or Dami. And honestly… I wasn’t sure I wanted to.”

“Ahh, Jesu,” my mother cried, tears now flowing down her face.

“Farayiola, o ba ma ṣe bàyìí,” she sobbed. (Farayiola, you shouldn’t have done this.)

Ayo’s eyes lifted again, this time locking directly on me.


“Then I see the Pressure Fehintola is under because of you,” Ayo said quietly,

“I don’t want that life. I’m happy here.”

“Don’t be ridiculous my son!” my father cautioned softly, even though I knew he tried to keep his voice restrained. I shook my head slowly.

“Happy? How can you claim happiness in this filth?” He sneered, his lip curling.

“Ìwọ ọmọ onílé, ọmọ ọlọ́rọ (a child born into wealth). And you say you’re happy rotting here?”

“That’s enough!” Dami roared, his voice cutting through the air turning the compound silent at once.

He stepped forward, his eyes glossy and bloodshot red. Oh my God, I really messed things up big time.

“I’ve heard enough of this. I understand perfectly what’s happening here now. And I want you all to leave. All of you!”

“Dami, please!” I cried, reaching for him, my voice trembling. But he wouldn’t even look at me.

“You! You! Every one of you… out of my property!” he thundered.

“Of course,” my father scoffed, straightening his shirt.

“I will not waste another minute in this filthy place.”

“Daddy!” I gasped, trying to caution him in.

“You have thirty minutes,” he barked, pointing at me.

“Pack your things and join me in the car. And you too” he added turning to Ayo.

“I’m sorry, but I don’t think you are in any position to father me around,” Ayo shot back instantly. My father’s head snapped toward my mother, who was still sobbing softly.

“Farayiola, please,” she pleaded through tears. “Come with us. We’re your family. We’ve been searching for you for years. Believe me, we never gave up.”

“I have every right to decide if I want to go or not,” Ayo muttered, shaking his head.

“Go,” Dami whispered suddenly. Ayo and I turned to him at once.

“Dami, I …”

“I said go!” he bellowed, his voice breaking.

“Go with them!”

My father’s face hardened. “You have thirty minutes,” he repeated coldly. Grabbing my mother’s hand, he stormed out without another word.

The silence that followed their exit was the noisest place I’ve ever been in. Dami’s chest rose and fell in sharp bursts as he slowly turned to me.

“You lied to me,” he whispered hoarsely. His eyes, bloodshot and glassy still, brimming with unshed tears. Never did I think Dami would ever shed tear, especially not because of me.

“All of you. You played me. You all knew the truth, and you played me still.”

“Dami, please, I ..”

“So what was the plan?” he cut me off, his voice trembling with fury.

“To rip me off? To buy my winery and turn it into some overpriced label so the very people who inspire me could never afford it?”

I swallowed hard.

“Yes, at first, maybe. I just wanted to sign the contract for my dad and get over it. But that was before I knew you were the owner. Before I spent time here. Dami, I swear, I wasn’t trying to rip you off. I wanted your winery to succeed without my father, just as much as you did.”

“And then what?” His laugh was bitter. “You think you can just stroll back here after five years and decide the fate of my winery?”

“Like we’re some project, no?”

“No, Dami, that’s not what it is …”

“Oh, so you just forgot where you came from the moment you left, is that it?” he snapped.

“That’s not true, and you know it,” I whimpered, tears spilling freely.

His expression softened just slightly, but his voice was steady, resigned.

“Fehintola… I don’t want to say things I’ll regret. I don’t want more trouble with your family. Please… go. And don’t come back.”

He turned to Ayo then, placing a firm hand on his shoulder.

“You should go too.”

“No!” Ayo protested immediately, his voice breaking. “You can’t tell me what to do!”

Dami’s tears finally fell. He managed a small, broken smile.

“Remember how you always said you were curious about your parents? Well, here they are. I’ve held onto you longer than I should have. It would be selfish to drag you down with me.”

“I choose to stay!” Ayo snapped, shaking his head stubbornly.

“Nobody is dragging anybody anywhere” he added. Dami’s grip tightened on his shoulder.

“I want to be alone, Ayo. Please. You’ll always be my brother. You’ll always be welcome here.” His hand lingered before he pulled away and turned to Anu.

“I’m sorry,” she whispered, unable to meet his eyes.

“It shouldn’t have been you, Anu,” he murmured, shaking his head.

“It shouldn’t have.”

“Also, tell your father, I’ll rather go down fighting for my winery than bow to his greedy desires!” He said. Without another word, he turned and walked inside, leaving us standing there and just staring.

Anu exhaled shakily, then turned to Ayo. She squeezed his shoulder gently.

“I think You should go. Come back later.”

She hesitated, then faced me. “You too.” Her eyes softened with guilt.

“I’m so sorry, Fehintola. I never meant to rat you out. I slipped, it was a mistake.” I sniffled, shaking my head.

“It’s not your fault. I should never have lied.”

“I’ll stay with him,” she promised.

“I’ll keep you updated. Don’t worry, we’ll hold everything down here for the festivities.”

I wiped my nose with the back of my hand and nodded. “Thank you.”

“I’ll keep posting videos, keep sharing. I know God will come through for us,” she said firmly.

I pulled her into a hug, clinging to her warmth. “Thank you… thank you so much.”

“It’s fine,” she murmured against my shoulder. Pulling back, she gave me a small smile.

“Come. I’ll pack with you”

I nodded wordlessly, and just followed her in.
