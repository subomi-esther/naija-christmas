FEHINTOLA

Twelve Days Later.

19th December 2024.

At the Winery.

“I know orders are coming in, but… this won’t quite cut it,” Dami muttered, his voice low with frustration. We stood outside behind the production area as we just watched the workers do their thing.

His words sounded like he was disappointed and I felt it pressing against my own chest tightly. Slowly, I moved closer, slipping my arms around his waist, offering the only solace I could at that moment.

“Have you lost hope?” I asked gently, my voice barely above a whisper.

“Has God ever failed you before?”

Dami turned to face me, his tired eyes meeting mine. He shook his head and let out a heavy sigh.

“No, He hasn’t,” he admitted, his voice tinged with exhaustion.

“But in times like this, it’s hard to keep believing… to hold on to hope. I cannot help but panic”

“The landlord is not taking it easy with me and honestly I need to get my own bigger space,”

“It’s not just about bigger space too, will I just get a bigger space and not furnish or design it or even buy more machines,”

“I keep worrying about these things Ifemi (My love),” he muttered and slowly pulled away slightly to look at me well.

“Should I take another loan? But no! I’ve spent almost all my five years in this business taking loans” he muttered, sucked in air and turned back with a small sigh.

It felt good—different, even—that he wasn’t hiding behind his usual brave facade. He was letting me in, sharing his doubts and fears openly. That vulnerability was something I’d longed for, and I didn’t take it for granted. I tightened my arms around him and looked up, my voice steady and full of conviction and reassurance.

“Just trust Him, my love. I’ll be here with you every step of the way. You’re not alone in this.”

Dami stared at me for a moment, Slowly, his lips curved into a small, grateful smile.

“You have no idea how much that means to me,” he said softly. “I love you so much, Ifemi.”

The butterflies in my stomach went into a shameless and unrelenting dance, they always did that anytime he said he loves me. A finished woman and more, I like ittt.

“I love you too,” I replied, the words spilling from my lips sincerely and without any restraint.

But even as we stood there, wrapped in each other’s warmth, a small corner of my mind wandered elsewhere—to my father.

You might ask why I seemed so at peace, why my mind felt balanced when everything with him remained unresolved. Truthfully, I hadn’t sorted things out with him. I hadn’t even told Dami the real reason I came in the first place, not with how smoothly everything is going, I couldn’t bring myself to.

If my father had come storming to this place to demand answers or drag me back home, it wouldn’t be out of his character and I’m surprised he hasn’t and he hasn’t been disturbing me too much on call. I’d done nothing but frustrate him over the past two weeks, and even I knew it.

“Fehintola!”

My breath hitched. That voice was distinct, unmistakable, and vibrating with anger as always, it sent a jolt through my body. I froze for a second, then let go of Dami as if I’d burned him. Slowly, I turned around, my heart pounding erratically, to see my father standing behind me at the entrance of the winery. My mother was on his left, and Anjola, ever smug, was on his right. I would definitely not put this visit past her.

“Fehintola Rachael Bankole!” my father bellowed. Oh, Jesus Christ.

I opened my mouth to respond, but no words came out. My tongue felt heavy, and all I could do was stammer uselessly.

“Good afternoon, sir. I’m sorry, I—” Dami began probably because, but my father cut him off with a rude snort.

“Have you signed the contract?!” my father demanded, his brows raised in exasperation.

Panic surged through me. I darted toward him in an effort to stop whatever was coming, but it was futile. The damage was already done.

“Contract? What’s he talking about?” Dami’s voice was low, his words laced with confusion as his gaze swung towards me. My chest tightened painfully, my hands trembling at my sides.

“Wait—don’t tell me you haven’t told him!” my father roared. His words were sharp, cutting deep.

“Fehintola, you promised me! You said if I got the NAFDAC registration sorted, you’d definitely make him sign the contract!”

“Dad, stop!” I pleaded, but he was relentless.

“Banks Nigeria didn’t rise to the top because of sentimentality! Do you want to ruin my company?!” he yelled, his voice echoing if not through the whole street. Dami took a step back, his face pale as realization dawned.

“You…you work for Banks Nigeria?” he stammered. My father scoffed derisively.

“Work for? So, he doesn’t even know who you are?” He turned to Dami, his expression hard. “She’s my daughter. She’s the heiress to Banks Nigeria!”

No. No. No.

This wasn’t how I wanted him to find out. Truthfully, I never wanted him to know at all. My heart pounded in my ears as I turned to Dami, who now looked like the ground beneath him was crumbling.

“Ifemi,” he whispered, his voice trembling.

“Tell me this is a lie. You’re pranking me, right?” His lips stretched into a forced, shaky smile.

Before I could respond, my father interjected, his tone scornful.

“Ifemi?” He barked a bitter laugh, his gaze darting between us.

“So, it’s true? Anjola showed me those silly videos you two were making here. I thought it was part of your strategy. So now you’re dating him too? Is that why you’ve been refusing to take my calls?”

“Dad, enough!” I snapped, but he ignored me.

“In what world do you think you can bring this kind of person home and expect me to approve? When will you start realizing who you are, Fehintola? People like him should work for you! He’s beneath you!”

“Stop it!” I shouted, but he didn’t stop, he didn’t seem like he was going to anytime soon. He turned to Dami, his voice dropping to a menacing growl.

“And you—don’t you know your place? I trained her to be high maintenance. Can you even afford her? Seeing as you’ve stubbornly refused my offer to upgrade yourself, do you really think I’d let my daughter live in this filthy area with you?”

Dami’s eyes burned with hurt and anger as he turned to me.

“So, it’s true?” he asked softly.

“No, it’s not like that! I can explain” I pleaded, my voice cracking. I reached out toward him, but he stepped back.

“Explain what, Fehintola? That you’ve been lying to me all along?” His voice was rising now, laced with bitterness.

“You asked me to be vulnerable with you. For what? To use it against me? To humiliate me like this? To hurt me?”

Before I could respond, another voice broke through the chaos.

“What’s going on here?”

All heads turned to the entrance to see Ayo and Anu stepping out. Anu threw me a curious glance and I sighed softly, she kept telling me to come out clean to Dami, I should have listened to her. Ayo locked eyes with my father.

“Jesu mi o!” my parents cried simultaneously, rushing toward him and shoving me aside in their haste.

“Farayiola!” my mother called, her voice trembling.

I froze, my head whipping between Ayo and my parents.

“What the heck are you doing?!” I exclaimed, rushing toward them.

“You’re already so much problem, stop making everyone uncomfortable! Just stop!”

Ayo lifted his head, meeting my father’s suddenly longing gaze with a resigned expression.

“How did you find me?” he asked quietly.

What?

My stomach dropped. I turned to Ayo in shock. What the heck was he talking about?
