FEHINTOLA

I swallowed hard as I stepped closer to Anu, my heart pounding so loudly in my chest, my fist clenching and unclenching as I stood in front of her. She stood still, her expression remained unreadable, her piercing gaze fixed on me. My voice trembled as I whispered, I don’t know why I was this scared but I was actually scared.

“A-Anu, it’s not what you think…”

She didn’t respond, didn’t flinch. She just stood there staring at me. I tried again, my voice unsteady.

“Anu, I can explain.”

I was standing directly in front of her now, close enough to see the subtle rise and fall of her chest as she breathed. My mind raced with possibilities of how this situation would turn out, each one worse than the last. This wasn’t how I wanted them to find out. Finally, she spoke, her voice calm but very firm.

“Bankole Fehintola Racheal,” she began.

“The only daughter of Bankole Philips, I knew the moment I saw you.”

I blinked, stunned by her words, and my eyes widened in shock.

“Y-you knew?” I stammered, my voice barely above a whisper. She nodded slowly, lowering her hands to her sides.

“What did you expect? I’m D&A’s PR manager and Dami’s personal assistant all rolled into one. It’s my job to know everything.” I felt my stomach drop. She continued, her voice steady and matter-of-fact.

“Banks Nigeria has been sending us emails non-stop. People like them don’t fly under the radar—not in my line of work.” She paused, her gaze softening slightly.

“I know you’re trying to run from your father’s name, but trust me—the media always knows. Truth is you can’t get rid of his name around you completely, that’s your source, you have to find a way around it.” I exhaled deeply, at a loss for words.

“I’m not trying to ruin anything for you guys,” I managed to say, my voice desperate to prove that I didn’t mean any harm. Her lips thinned as she folded her arms across her chest again, like she was considering my words. Then, a faint smile flickered across her face.

“So,” I muttered hesitantly, “are you going to tell Dami?” I asked, She tilted her head slightly, as she stepped close to me.

“I’ve known all these time, Fehintola. If I wanted to say something, I would have already. What makes you think I’ll start now?”

Relief washed over me, and I released a breath I hadn’t realized I was holding.

“Anu—” I started, but she raised a hand to stop me.

“I know you’re hesitating,” she said softly, cutting me off.

“And I get it. But listen to me—Dami deserves to hear this from you, not someone else. The longer you keep it hidden, the worse it’ll be.” Her gaze was steady, her tone firm.

“I’m not going to interfere,” she continued. “For now, I’ll keep pretending I don’t know anything. But Fehintola, you need to come clean. The earlier, the better.”

Her voice softened, the sharpness giving way to a quiet sincerity.

“You’re a good person, Fehintola. I believe that. But being good means doing the right thing—even when it’s hard.”

I opened my mouth to respond, but before I could form the words, we both froze at the sound of a familiar voice calling my name.

“Fehintola?”

We turned in unison to find Dami standing a few meters behind us.

“Dami?”

“What are you two doing out here in the dark all alone ? Why aren’t you with the rest of us?” Dami’s voice cut through the silent night, his footsteps growing louder as he approached. I stiffened for a moment, but his relaxed expression made it obvious he hadn’t overheard anything. Relief swept through me, and I exhaled softly, nodding to myself.

Anu turned to him with a faint smile, her composure as steady as ever, and I couldn’t be more thankful that it was her who overheard me.

“We were just talking,” she said quietly, then glanced at me, her fingers curling around a small object.

“I also wanted to give you this.” I followed her gaze to her outstretched hand and saw the flash drive.

“The pictures,” she whispered.

“Oh oh,” I muttered, I nodded and took it from her, my fingers brushing hers briefly.

“Thank you,” I murmured, my Thank you even much more than the pictures she took for me, I think she understood because she passed me a knowing smile.

She gave a quick bow, her smile barely there again, and walked away without another word. Dami’s eyes followed her retreating figure before shifting back to me, his brow furrowed in concern.

“Are you okay? You’ve been a bit off all day,” he said softly.

“Care to share what’s on your mind? J I s this because of the conversation you had with your dad? What’s going on?” I forced a smile, though it didn’t quite reach my eyes.

“I’m fine, Dami. Really. You don’t need to worry about me.”

He didn’t look convinced. Instead, he stepped closer, gently taking my hands in his. His gaze held mine, steady and searching, like if he looked deep enough, he could actually see what was bothering me.

“Fehintii, you know you can talk to me, right? Whatever this is, I’m here for you.” My smile faltered, and I shook my head.

“It’s nothing, Dami. The same old stuff. You already have enough on your plate. I don’t want to add to it.” He sighed, like he felt annoyed that he couldn’t help me. Slowly, he let go of my hands, only to pull me into a firm, comforting hug. His arms wrapped around me like a shield, warm and steady.

“Whatever it is, Fehintii, just know I’m here for you. Anytime,” he said softly.

I nodded against his chest, a small, genuine smile tugging at my lips.

“Of course,” I whispered. God, I was I supposed to come out clean.

11:00pm

“We finished early today, you can sleep better today,” he said as we walked home, my lips stretched into a small smile and I nodded slowly.

“Actually,” I said, he burst out in a laugh, loud and teasing.

“See your mouth like actually. Fehintola leave sleep and touch God!” He said, I rolled my eyes at him and raised the corner of my lips in a sneer.

“Anybody that hear you talking now, will think you don’t sleep at all,” I said and his laughter only deepened.

“Abeggi!” I muttered pushing him away from me.

“It’s true oh, I realized Ayo doesn’t really stay for the program, he just sets up and leaves” I asked, he sighed deeply, his smile slowly leaving his face.

“He’s really not that good with crowd, he’s always around somewhere but not just among the crowd,” he said and I nodded slowly.

“Oh,”

“He’s a very funny guy though, I’m sure you guys have a lot of fun together,” I said and he smiled.

“Ofcourse, ofcourse, we do”
