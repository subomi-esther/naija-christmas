FEHINTOLA

My heart skipped a beat as I immediately stretched forward, snatching my phone from his hand. I unlocked it quickly and scrolled down to my messages. There it was—a text from my mother.

-Your father has spoken to Mr. Ade. The winery will be reopened soon, but make sure you do as you’re asked. I don’t want wahala oh-

I exhaled softly, relief washing over me. It wasn’t as bad as I had feared, and at least it didn’t expose anything that could blow my cover.

“Dami, I was only trying to help,” I murmured, glancing up at him. He raised his brows, then slowly got up from where he sat.

“You think throwing your money around and flaunting your connections is helping me?” he shot back, his tone sharp.

“So what now, I’m indebted to you?!” I flinched, taken aback by his words, and instinctively stepped back.

“There’s no debt in Love Dami, what do you mean throwing my money around? When have I ever done that? You needed help, and I just wanted to be there for you.” I said and he scoffed lowly slowly shaking his head sideways.

“Did I ask for your help?” he snapped.

“I said I could handle it! But no, being the Fehintola that you are, you went ahead and did whatever you wanted!”

“You’re trying to play hero around here?”

“Hero? What are you talking about Dami? You think this is what this is about? It’s not that serious, Dami. Calm down.”

“Not that serious? You think I’m that helpless?” His voice rose, brimming with frustration.

“Same thing you did yesterday! You ridiculously sent 100k to that guy, without even batting an eyelid—even after I told you not to! Why? Do you think I’m broke? Do you think your money solves everything? Do you think I care about how much you have in your account?”

His words came tumbling out all at once, leaving me stunned. I stared at him, unable to respond, my mind scrambling for the right words.

“Dami! I was only trying to help!”

“And I said I don’t need your help! How hard is that for you to understand?” he barked.

“Don’t tell me you feel threatened by me? It’s not my fault that I was born into a wealthy family, it just happened Dami! I didn’t choose!” I yelled back, he scoffed with a low annoyed chuckle.

“Threatened by you? Why? Do you think I’m beneath you?! You’re out of my league?” He shot back.

My lips parted to argue, but no words came out. I didn’t even know where to start talking from, I guess they are all the same, both the educated and the un educated ones, all African men, has the same thinking pattern. I let out a long sigh and stepped back again, shaking my head.

“I’m sorry,” I muttered quietly.

“You should be,” he retorted coldly.

For a moment, silence hung between us. Then, he spoke again,

“You know, we’ve never really talked about why you came back.” He said, My head snapped up at his words, my heart pounding in my chest.

“When everything was going well for you, you never thought to come back,” Dami’s voice thundered, his words sharp enough to cut through my chest and break my heart.

“But the moment things fell apart, you came running back to Ikorodu. We’re nothing more than distractions to you right, distractions from real life, distractions from your ambitions. At least, that’s what you said yourself.”

Tears welled in my eyes, spilling over as I slowly looked up at him. I could see the vein in his neck as he spoke angrily, his words laced with bitterness.

“Why are you bringing up the past, Dami?” I whispered, struggling to keep my voice from trembling.

“Why not?” he shot back.

“Isn’t that how you really feel? I didn’t fit into your plans for the future before, but now I do, right?”

“Is that why you desperately want to save the winery? So I’d be presentable Atleast to your family?”

“That’s not true.” I muttered, I really just couldn’t believe that he had kept in all these thoughts about me.

“Oh, it’s not?” He let out a bitter laugh.

“You think you can just come back, make me fall head over heels for you, and then leave the moment you’re good and ready to face your fast-paced, ambitious life again, You think you can leave me here to pick up the pieces of my heart after you’ve shattered it—again.”

“Is that what you think of me?” I asked, my voice breaking. “That I’d just leave?”

“Have you given me any reason to believe otherwise?” he countered, his words piercing through my resolve.

“Isn’t it ten days you planned to stay here?” His voice rose again, filled with pain.

“Two more days, and this... this little game of ours will be over. So why not start pulling away now?”

“Dami!” I cried, trying to rein in my emotions, but the tears wouldn’t stop.

“You think this is a game? You think I’m playing with you?”

His jaw clenched as he stared at me, his eyes bloodshot and blazing with frustration and anger. I sniffled, wiping my face with trembling hands.

“You can’t carry the weight of the world on your shoulders,” I said, my voice trembling but firm. “You can’t keep pushing people away just because you think accepting help makes you weak. Refusing help doesn’t make you strong, Dami—it makes you vulnerable. It makes you self-sabotaging, and one day, it’ll leave you completely drained and alone.”

He opened his mouth to argue, but I cut him off, my voice gaining strength.

“You’re smart, Dami. You’re learned and I expected better from you. But this perfectionism you cling to? It’s going to destroy you. Accepting help, especially from someone who you love, doesn’t diminish your worth—it strengthens you. I only wanted to stand by you, to make this burden lighter. But if you think I’m overstepping, fine. I’ll step back. I’ll know my place and stay in it.”

I wiped my face again, turned on my heel, and started toward the door, my heart breaking with every step. But something made me pause. Slowly, I turned back to face him.

“Not everyone you love is going to leave you, Dami,” I said, my voice steady despite the ache in my chest.

“Can’t you see that?”

“You can’t keep judging everyone by the wounds of your past. I’m not your mother Damilare, and I’d appreciate it if you’d stop looking at me as though I’ll hurt you the same way she did.”

His face tightened, but he said nothing, the storm in his eyes swirling with emotions he wouldn’t voice.

“You can’t tie me down to stay with you, Dami. You’re just going to have to trust me. And if you don’t trust me, then there’s no point in us being together.”

“If we don’t have trust, we don’t have anything.”

With that, I turned and stormed out, slamming the door shut behind me with a loud thud.

••

I walked into my apartment, the soft click of the door closing behind me echoing in the silence. Without turning on the lights, I headed straight to the kitchen. My movements were automatic, mechanical. I pulled a bottle of water from the fridge and returned to the living room, sinking into the sofa with a quiet sigh.

Twisting the cap open, I raised the bottle to my lips, drinking deeply until it was empty. The cool liquid did little to quench the burning ache in my chest. I placed the empty bottle on the coffee table, my fingers lingering on it for a moment before retreating to my lap.

I blinked rapidly, trying to hold back the tears stinging my eyes. I’d cried too much already this month—over men, of all things. And it was only the beginning of the month. But no matter how hard I tried, the pain wouldn’t go away.

My hand flew to my chest, pressing lightly against the dull ache spreading there. The tears came anyway, sliding down my cheeks in defiance. I wiped them away furiously, but they only fell faster. Soon, soft sobs broke free from my lips, and I buried my face in my hands, letting it all out.

Everything Dami said replayed in my head like a cruel, endless loop. I’d done nothing but help him. I put his needs above my own, above saving my father’s business, and this was my reward. His words cut deep, leaving scars I couldn’t see but felt with every breath.

My phone buzzed on the sofa beside me, pulling me from the spiral of my thoughts. I picked it up slowly, my vision blurred with tears, and squinted at the message.

-Have you spoken to him now? Has he agreed?-

I hissed under my breath and flung the phone back onto the cushion. Ta le leyi? (Who is this one again?)

If only my father knew what I was going through here, he wouldn’t be sending me texts like this—nagging me, pushing me. But no, he had no idea. None of them did. And for now, I had no strength to explain.
