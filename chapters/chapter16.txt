FEHINTOLA.

12:00pm.

Dami’s arms wrapped snugly around my shoulders, as we made our way out of the town square. My fingers instinctively found his, intertwining as if they belonged there.

“You didn’t have to do that in public,” I murmured, casting a side glance at him. We had just finished setting down and packing up everything we used and were now heading home.

“I wanted to,” he replied without hesitation. “And I’d do it every time I get the chance.” He added, I couldn’t help but glance up at him, a small smile tugging at my lips.

“Aww, stop,” I muttered, heat rising to my cheeks. His soft chuckle made my stomach flutter, but I quickly sobered, lowering my gaze.

“Dami, there’s something I need to—”

“Ah-ah, ahn-ahn! This one don do!” Ayo’s voice boomed from behind, startling us both. Before we could react, he wedged himself between us, shoving us apart with zero remorse. Wrapping his arms around our shoulders, then he pulled us close to himself.

“Hold me instead,” he declared, his grin wide and mischievous. Dami immediately rolled his eyes and shrugged off Ayo’s arm, stepping away from him.

“Which kind of person are you sef?” he muttered in exasperation.

“Come back here!” Ayo snorted, yanking Dami back by the collar and locking an arm tightly around his shoulders again.

“You think you can escape me, abi? You gats explain wetin Dey occur!”

“So, you guys e tin gbe nkan gba eyin mi Abi?” *(You’re doing things behind my back, abi?)*

Ayo demanded, his head snapping back and forth between the two of us like a detective on a mission.

“Big Brother Ayo, it’s not what you think!” I said quickly, my hands raised in defense.

“Ehn ehn, tell me what I’m thinking,” he shot back playfully, arching a brow.

“Because that last time una talk say na joke, but that kiss no look like joke to me oh!”

“Ayo, we’re not dating,” I said firmly. “If anything were to happen, trust me, I’d tell you.”

“We’re not dating yet,” Dami interjected with a sly grin, earning a sharp glare from Ayo.

Ayo immediately dropped his arm from my shoulders and faced Dami fully, his eyes narrowing.

“See your mouth. You too like woman!” Dami smirked, unbothered by the jab.

“After all the pepper wey una eye don see, love still dey sweet you? Una no dey learn ni?” (After all the heartbreak you’ve experienced, love still excites you? Don’t you learn?) Ayo asked, shaking his head in disbelief.

The three of us burst into laughter at his dramatic exasperation, and Dami tapped him on the shoulder.

“Isn’t that love?” he said with a grin.

“As James Baldwin said, ‘Love does not begin or end the way we seem to think it does. Love is a battle; love is a war.’”

Ayo raised a brow and curled his lip in a sneer.

“Abeggi! Ikorodu Shakespeare isonu! You don see woman, now you dey quote Baldwin. Dey talk wetin I no understand”

“Don’t mind him, oh!” Ayo added, turning to me with a mock conspiratorial look, and I couldn’t help but laugh.

“Ayo,” a soft voice called, interrupting us. We all turned to see Anu standing a few feet away, her presence immediately shifting the mood. His teasing demeanor disappeared in an instant, he let go of us and stood up straight.

“Ah, are you leaving already?” he asked, stepping away from us to approach her.

“Yes,” she replied with a small smile, “But I can wait if you’re still busy.” She added. Ayo shook his head quickly.

“No, no. I’ll take you. Do you want me to drop you off?” Dami and I exchanged wide-eyed glances, barely suppressing our surprise. Ehn Ehn! Ayo and Anu, since when.

“I’ll see you two later,” he said over his shoulder as he walked away with Anu, leaving us to stare after him in disbelief.

“Ehn ehn! Ayo! Iwo! (You), You dey use accent follow me talk now?” Dami called out, obviously very surprised as he watched Ayo stride off towards his car with Anu by his side.

“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Ayo replied, his tone cool and measured. He opened the car door for Anu,

Anu gave Dami a small bow before acknowledging me with a quick nod. I returned her nod with a polite smile as she got into the car and Ayo shut the door behind her,

“So, you’ll carry woman in your car and leave your brother to trek?” Dami said, throwing his hands in the air dramatically. Ayo turned back to us with a raised brow and a faint smile tugging at his lips as he dropped his voice.

“Shebi you get babe? The more, the merrier. A couple that treks together, stays together,” he said, his voice light but very teasing.

“You sef, vex and buy car. Suffer no dey tire you?” Ayo retorted, a playful look in his eyes as he rounded the car and got into the driver’s seat.

“Ayo, because of woman, I swear you don suffer for my hand!” Dami shot back, but Ayo didn’t bother responding. Instead, he slammed the car door shut, started the engine, and drove off, leaving us behind.

Dami shook his head, a small smile creeping onto his face as he muttered something under his breath. Then, he turned to me with a playful grin.

“Let’s go, jare. Fine girl,” he said, his arm once again finding its place around my shoulders.

“Anu and Ayo. Who would have thought. Anybody that hears that boy speaking will think he has sold his heart. Such a pretender” he said and I chuckled lightly at his words.

“Oh, by the way, You wanted to say something earlier?” he asked, his voice softer now,

“Oh, that?” I hesitated, feeling uncertain about telling him now.

“It’s nothing,” I muttered, He studied me for a moment, before asking,

“You’re sure?”

I nodded, offering a small smile to reassure him. But deep down, I knew there was more I needed to say—just not today.

Today’s mission failed. We go harder tomorrow.
